# #HYPEHARVEST

A single-serving site offering all the details of the [Madison Ruby](http://madisonruby.org) pre-show event titled #HYPEHARVEST.

The conference has grown a reputation for being [one of the best around](https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/361624150286155777) and as such people just want to be involved. We've built a great event and are now harvesting some of the hype that surrounds our event. In traditional Madison Ruby Style it's not all tech it includes music and local speakers.

Storytelling without slides under the darkening sky.
